                <img class="floatLeft" src="images/logo.jpg" alt="happydrummer">
                My mission is to inspire and equip aspiring drummers in Johnson City and beyond 
                with the skills, knowledge, and passion needed to confidently express themselves 
                through drumming. I aim to provide a welcoming and supportive environment that fosters 
                growth, creativity, and community. Through personalized drum lessons, resources, and events, 
                I strive to help my students achieve their musical goals and find joy in the art of drumming.

            Here at Adrian's Drumming I wanna help you become the greatest musician you can! 
            Ever since I was a kid I've always loved music, and I want to pass on that love to the 
            next generation. I have a wide range of playing ability, and an infinite amount of patience.
